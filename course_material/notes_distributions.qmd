## Discrete probability distribution

Here we deal with stochastic trials where the set of all possible outcomes is countable and known.

A **discrete random variable** maps each of the trial outcomes to a numeric value.

A **discrete probability distribution** assigns a probability for each of the possible numeric values representing the outcomes.

All possible outcomes for a probability distribution should sum to 1.

#### Example: Dice Trowing

Trowing a dice has 6 possible outcomes with equal probability. We can define a random variable $X$ that maps each of the outcomes when trowing a dice to the numeric values 1,2,3,4,5,6. The probability distribution $P(X=x)$ assigns the following probabilities to each value $X=x$:

| $x$      | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
|----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| $P(X=x)$ | 1/6 | 1/6 | 1/6 | 1/6 | 1/6 | 1/6 |

### Bernoulli trials

Often a process has two outcomes.

-   Coin tossing: outcomes are **head or tail**.

-   HIV test looks for the **presence or absence** of antibodies in the blood.

-   A child is born with **a certain condition or not**.

Or from a stochastic trial with multiple outcomes, there are two outcomes of interest:

-   throw a dice, you are only interested in whether you **get a 6 or not**.

-   A child is born **with a weight lower than 2500 grams or not**.

### Binomial trials

A bionomial trial consist of a **series of Bernoulli trials** that satisfy the following:

-   In each trial, we can record whether certain event $A$ occurs or not.

-   The probability of A, $P(A)$ is the same in each trial, it is denoted by $p$.

-   All trials are independent.

Suppose we carry out n trials, looking for an event A in each trial. As a result we obtain a sequence:

$$A, \bar{A}, A, A, \bar{A}, ..., A$$

Say that $A$ takes place $x$ times. This means $\bar{A}$ takes place $n-x$ times.

What is the probability for a certain sequence?

Recall that probabilities for independent events can be multiplied.

$$P(sequence) = p \times (1-p) \times p ... \times p$$

For $x$ number of $p$ and $n-x$ number of $1-p$,

$$P(sequence) = p^{x} (1-p)^{n-x}$$

The order of the sequence does not matter. The number of occurence matters. The number of ways that $x$ objects can be chosen from a total of $n$ objects, regardless of order is given by the bionomical coefficient.

### Binomial coefficient

We want to find the number of ways that $x$ objects can be chosen from a total of $n$ objects, regardless of order

Binomial coefficient: $\binom nx$

$$\binom nx = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}$$

"x factorial": $x! = x \times (x-1) \times ... 2 \times 1$

Example: $\binom 4 3 = \frac{4\times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1} = 4$

## Binomial distribution

The probability that $A$ occurs exact $x$ times is given by

$$P(X = x) = \binom n x p^{x}(1-p)^{n-x}$$

i.e. the number of distributing $x$ events in a sequence of length $n$, times the probability that one particular sequence with $x$ events occurs.

For a binomial distribution, the mean (or expected value) is $np$ and the variance is $np(1-p)$.

#### Example: Number of positive tests

Let's say $p=0.15$ is the probability that a person taking a test for a certain disease get a positive result. A certain day, we are going to do $n=8$ such tests. The number of positive test in a sequence of of 8 test is random variable that is binomially distributed, often written Binom(8,0.15). This binomial distribution can be represented as below.

-   What is the probability that you get 2 or more positives?
-   What is the expected number of positive tests (the mean)?
-   What is the variance and the standard deviation?

#### Example: Family with four kids

We consider a family with 4 kids, with no monozygotic twins, so the gender of the kids are approximately independent. The probability of getting a boy in Norway is approximately 0.514. Using the formula for the binomial distribution we can compute the probability that that out of the 4 kids the number of boys is 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 as follwos:

$$
P(X=0)=\binom 4 0 0.514^0 \cdot 0.486^4 = 0.0557
$$ $$
P(X=1)=\binom 4 1 0.51^1 \cdot 0.49^3 = 0.2360
$$

$$
P(X=2)=\binom 4 2 0.51^2 \cdot 0.49^2 = 0.3744
$$ $$
P(X=3)=\binom 4 3 0.51^3 \cdot 0.49^1 = 0.2639
$$ $$
P(X=4)=\binom 4 4 0.51^4 \cdot 0.49^0 = 0.0697
$$

In the following table we compare our theoretical estimates with real-life percentage distribution in 7745 American families with 4 kids.

| Number of boys | Binomial distribution ($\%$) | Observed distribution ($\%$) |
|--------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0              | 5.6                          | 5.3                          |
| 1              | 23.6                         | 22.9                         |
| 2              | 37.4                         | 38.3                         |
| 3              | 26.4                         | 26.5                         |
| 4              | 7.0                          | 6.9                          |

## Continuous probability distribution

Here we deal with **continuous stochastic variables**. In contrast to counting variables, continuous variables can take any (of the infinite) values within a given range. For instance, height, cholesterol and annual salary can be considered continuous variables.

A probability distribution (or density) for a continuous variable $X$ is a function $f$ satistying the following:

-   $f(x)\geq 0~~\text{for all}~~x~~\text{in}~~X$.
-   The total area under the curve of $f$ is 1.
-   The probability that $x$ is between two values $a$ and $b$, denoted $P(a\leq x \leq b)$ equals the area under the curve from $a$ to $b$.

![Probability density for a continuous variable](images/prob_density_cont_variable.png){fig-align="center"}

## Normal distribution

This is the most important probability distribution in statistics. It will be widely used in this course.

Probability density function of the normal distribution has this formula:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \text{exp}(- \frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})$$

-   $\mu$ is the mean

-   $\sigma$ is the standard deviation

-   $\text{exp}(x) = e^{x}$

### Properties of the normal distribution

![](images/properties_normal_dist.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Symmetric, bell-shape

-   $\mu$ and $\sigma$ define the location and variation

-   From the center (mean), going two standard deviations each way covers approximately 95% of the distribution

#### Examples: location $\mu$, variation $\sigma$

### Standard normal distribution

A normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma)$ with $\mu = 0, \sigma = 1$

Any normal disribution can be transformed into a standard normal distribution $N(0, 1)$ by substracting the meand and dividing by the standard deviation:

if $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)$, then $Y = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0, 1)$.

Standard normal distribution probabilities are commonly presented in tables, so people can check them easily. But in this course we will learn how to compute them with R.

#### Examples: Birthweight

This figure shows the brithweight of 189 newborns

![](images/birthweight_example_normal.png){fig-align="center"}

-   Estimates of \$\\mu\$ and \$\\sigma\$ are, respectively, 2945g and 729g

-   How can we compute the proportion of weights larger than 4000g?

We can either compute it directly in R as we will see in the R lab, or we can use the normal tables as follows:

$$
P(Y>4000) = 1- P(X \leq 4000) = 1 - P(\frac{X-2945}{729} \leq 1.45) 
$$

As the variable $\frac{X-2945}{729}$ is distributed according to the standard normal distribution, the probability $P(\frac{X-2945}{729} \leq 1.45)$ can be found in the tables, see Aalen p.328.

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(Y>4000) & = 1- P(X \leq 4000) = 1 - P(\frac{X-2945}{729} \leq 1.45)\\
          & = 1 - 0.9265 = 0.0735
\end{aligned} 
$$

## Normal approximation to the binomial distribution

Recall the binomial distribution,

$$P(X = x) = \binom nx p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$$

where $\binom nx = \frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}$, and $\binom n 0 = 1$

For large $n$, the binomial distribution can be approximated by the normal distribution.

![Histograms of the binomial distribution with p=0.2 and different n.](images/binomial_and_normal_approx.png){fig-align="center"}

### 

To approximate a binomial distribution we use a normal distribution with:

-   $\mu = np$

-   $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}$

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Example: Number of boys out of 20 new borns

-   $n=20$, $p=0.514$

-   $\mu=np=20 \cdot 0.514 = 10.28$

-   $\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{20 \cdot 0.514 \cdot 0.486} = 2.24$

-   $N(10.28,2.24)$

    ![](images/example_binomial_normal.png)
:::

Rule of thumb:

$Binom(n, p) \rightarrow N(\mu, \sigma)\quad \text{for} \quad n \rightarrow \infty$ if $np \geq 5$ and $n(1-p) \geq 5$

### Central limit theorem CLT

CLT in simple words: the distribution of **sample mean** will be nearly normal regardless of what distribution the variable in the population is, as long as the sample size is large enough.
