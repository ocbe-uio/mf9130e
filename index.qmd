## Use of the course material

This course website was built primarily with students taking MF9130E in mind, therefore the topics and examples are tailored to matche the existing teaching material we had been using at UiO.

However, the course material and website are **open source and fully publicly accessible**. We advocate strongly for **making learning statistics more accessible to everyone**. Feel free to spread the words! And do let us know if you benefit from the course and the website :)  

Please contact Chi Zhang [chi.zhang\@medisin.uio.no](mailto:chi.zhang@medisin.uio.no) if you have questions and feedbacks.
