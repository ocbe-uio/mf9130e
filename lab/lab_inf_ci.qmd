# Confidence interval



# Hypothesis testing

### Error

Type I error: conclude that there is an effect when there is not (false positive).

* controlled by **significance level**, $\alpha$
* usually choose $\alpha = 0.05$

Type II error: conclude there is not an effect when there really is (false negative).

* power: $1-\beta$
* a minimum for "good" power is usually 80%; i.e. 80% chance of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis if there is an effect.
