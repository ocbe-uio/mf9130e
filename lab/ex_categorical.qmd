## Datasets for exercises

For exercise I, it is the same dataset we have used in EDA (part I) from two days ago. You can use either `PEFH98-english.dta`, or `PEFH98-english.csv` data. 

For exercise II, we use a dataset called `birth.dta` (or `birth.csv`). 

If you forgot how to load the data, you can refresh your knowledge by reading these [notes](lab_eda_part1.qmd) (Example 2)

## Exercise 1 (lung function)

Lung function has been measured on 106 medical students. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEF, measured in liters per minute) was measured three times in a sitting position, and three times in a standing position.

The variables are 

* Age (years)
* Gender (1 is female, 2 is male)
* Height (cm)
* Weight (kg)
* PEF measured three times in a sitting position (pefsit1, pefsit2, pefsit3)
* PEF measured three times in a standing position (pefsta1, pefsta2, pefsta3)
* Mean of the three measurements made in a sitting position (pefsitm)
* Mean of the three measurements made in a standing position (pefstam)
* Mean of all six PEF values (pefmean)




#### 1a) 

We investigate whether having a high value of `pefmean` is associated with `gender`. 

First, create a new variable **highpef** that indicates whether `pefmean` is above 500.


#### 1b)

We investigate the association between these two variables via an appropriate table analysis. Make a table of `highpef` vs `gender`, and carry out a chi-square analysis. Interpret your results.



#### 1c)

Compute risk ratio and odds ratio (only the point estimates). Here the exposure is `gender` (we assume that the reference group is *female*: unexposed), and outcome is `highpef`. Interpret your results.

## Risk ratio and odds ratio

|          | Outcome (yes) | Outcome (no) |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Exposed  | a             | b            |
| Unexposed| c             | d            |

Risk ratio: $\frac{a/(a+b)}{c/(c+d)}$

Odds ratio: $\frac{a/b}{c/d} = \frac{ad}{bc}$

## Exercise 2 (birth data)

We shall analyse the data set given in the file `birth.dta`. In a study in Massachusetts, USA, birth weight was measured for the children of 189 women. The main variable in the study was birth weight, `BWT`, which is an important indicator of the condition of a newborn child. Low birth weight (below 2500 g) may be a medical risk factor. A major question is whether smoking during pregnancy influences the birth weight. One has also studied whether a number of other factors are related to birth weight, such as hypertension in the mother. 

The variables of the study are

* Identification number (ID)
* Low birth weight, 1 means $BWT \leq 2500g$, 0 means $BWT > 2500g$ (LOW) 
* Age of the mother (AGE)
* Weight (in pounds) at last menstruaal period (LWT)
* Ethnicity, 1 means White, 2 means African American, 3 meaans other (ETH)
* Smoking status, 1 means current smoker, 0 means not smoking during pregnancy (SMK)
* History of premature labbour, values 0, 1, 2... (PTL)
* History of hypertension, 1 is yes, 0 is no (HT)
* Uterine irritability, 1 is yes, 0 is no (UI)
* First trimester visits, values 0, 1, 2... (FTV)
* Third trimster visits, values 0, 1, 2... (TTV)
* Birth weight (BWT)




#### 2a) 

Does smoking influence the birth weight of a baby? 

Make a histogram and a box plot, and find the median and mean for birth weight in grams (`BWT`) for the two groups of mothers: group 1 that smokes, and group 2 that does not smoke durinng the pregnancy. (Hint: use variable `SMK` for this task)


#### 2b)

Are the distributions for the two groups normal? Can we conclude that smoking has an effect on the weight of a newborn? Use a t-test.


#### 2c)

Do mothers of hypertension have a tendency to have babies with a lower birth weight? (The variable for hypertension is `HT`)

Make a histogram of birth weight for the two groups of mothers with and without hypertension. What do you observe?
