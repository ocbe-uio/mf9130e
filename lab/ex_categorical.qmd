## Exercise 1 (lung function)

Lung function has been measured on 106 medical students. Peak expiratory flow rate (PEF, measured in liters per minute) was measured three times in a sittinng position, and three times in a standing position.

The variables are 

* Age (years)
* Gender (1 is female, 2 is male)
* Height (cm)
* Weight (kg)
* PEF measured three times in a sitting position (pefsit1, pefsit2, pefsit3)
* PEF measured three times in a standing position (pefsta1, pefsta2, pefsta3)
* Mean of the three measurements made in a sitting position (pefsitm)
* Mean of the three measurements made in a standing position (pefstam)
* Mean of all six PEF values (pefmean)

## Lung function data

This is the same dataset we have used in EDA (part I) from two days ago. You can use either `PEFH98-english.dta`, or `PEFH98-english.csv` data. 

If you forgot how to load the data, you can refresh your knowledge by reading these [notes](lab_eda_part1.qmd) (Example 2)
:::


#### 1a) 

We investigate whether having a high value of `pefmean` is associated with `gender`. 

First, create a new variable **highpef** that indicates whether `pefmean` is above 500.


#### 1b)

We investigate the association between these two variables via an appropriate table analysis. Make a table of `highpef` vs `gender`, and carry out a chi-square analysis. Interpret your results.



## Exercise 2 (birth data)

#### 2a) 

Does smoking influence the birth weight of a baby? 

Make a histogram and a box plot, and find the median and mean for birth weight in grams (`bwt`) for
