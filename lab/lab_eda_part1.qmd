Might be useful to have an outline and study goals 

# Data structure (use `penguins_mini` data as example)

**Bec student background, it is not necessary to go into too much details**

**MUST: concept of scalar, vector, matrix and data frame** (dataset exploration put to descriptive and eda)

**MUST: numeric, factor, character, logical**




# Exploring a dataset


head()

View()

str()

colnames()

dim()

nrow(), ncol()

length() of a vector 


# Basic data manipulation

only cover base R here; if needed, tidyverse put to eda 

by index, [row, col]



# Descriptive statistics 


min, max, median

IQR

summary
table () of a categorical vector



# Visualisation (only intro, details later)

### (base R)


### ggplot

Just some basics, since more specific types of viz will be shown in each section
