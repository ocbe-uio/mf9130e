Welcome! Here you will find material for **R lab and code** for this course. Lecture notes, videos and other resources can be found in [Course material](https://ocbe-uio.github.io/teaching_mf9130e/course_material/course_material_overview.html) page.

### Set up 

You need R for these exercises. It is recommended that you have R and RStudio on your laptop, but if there are problems with installation, you can choose Posit Cloud. 

If you don't have R yet, please read [this page](https://ocbe-uio.github.io/teaching_mf9130e/get_started/get_started.html) to get started.

### Data and R scripts

Datasets used for this course can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/teaching_mf9130e/tree/main/lab/data). R scripts used for each section are place in [this folder](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/teaching_mf9130e/tree/main/lab/code). 

In the first R lab session, we will go through how to download them from Github; you can also try it yourself following instructions on [this page](https://ocbe-uio.github.io/teaching_mf9130e/get_started/get_started.html).



# Lab notes and exercises

**Lab notes** contain 

* Brief summary of the topics discussed in class;
* Worked data analysis examples (code, visualisation) and some comments;
* Exercise solutions


**Exercises** (without solution) can be used when you want to try the examples by yourself. 

* The solution can be found in corresponding lab notes;
* You can open two tabs in your web browser, one without solution and another with solution in case you get stuck.

# How much programming do I need to learn?

If this is the first time you write code, you might find it a bit overwhelming. It is ok! *Not all* code shown in class are necessary to master; it's more for you to understand the topics we discussed. 

To help you with the exercises and homework, we have created this [list of commands](list_of_commands.qmd). This hopefully could make it easier to navigate through the course.
