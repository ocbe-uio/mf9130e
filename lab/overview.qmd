Welcome! Here you will find material for **R lab and code** for this course. 


### Set up 

You need R for these exercises. It is recommended that you have R and RStudio on your laptop, but if there are problems with installation, you can choose Posit Cloud. 

If you don't have R yet, please read [this page](https://ocbe-uio.github.io/teaching_mf9130e/get_started/get_started.html) to get started.

### Data and R scripts

**Datasets** can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/teaching_mf9130e/tree/main/lab/data). **R scripts** used for each section are placed in [this folder](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/teaching_mf9130e/tree/main/lab/code). 

In the first R lab session, we will go through how to download them from GitHub; you can also try it yourself following instructions on [this page](https://ocbe-uio.github.io/teaching_mf9130e/get_started/get_started.html).


If you have trouble downloading datasets from GitHub, please let us know as soon as possible.


# Lab notes and exercises

In the lab sessions, you will have time to go through the examples and exercises with the help from the instructors. In the lab notes you can find:

* Brief summary of the topics discussed in class;
* Worked data analysis examples with code and visualization;
* Exercises and solution

# How much programming do I need to learn?

If this is the first time you write R code, you might find it a bit overwhelming. It is ok! Programming is NOT the focus of this course.

*Not all* code shown in class are mandatory; it's more for you to understand the topics we discussed. 

To help you with the exercises and homework, we have created this [list of commands](list_of_commands.qmd). They should cover the most important commands for this course.
