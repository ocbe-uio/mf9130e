    "text": "Basic concepts\nA probability expresses a potential for something to happen.\nIt is an assessment of uncertainty in a situation or event.\nIt corresponds to the concept of risk in medicine.\n\nBrief history\nBlaise Pascal (17th century) was the founder of probability theory, the set of basic rules for doing probability calculations. His work was motivated by dice and card games.\nAndrey Kolmogorov formulated the exact probability rules as late as 1933.\n\n\nTwo definitions of probability\nFrequentist definition: Proportions of times (or frequency) that some event occurs in a large number of similar repeated trials.\nBayesian definition: Degree of belief in the occurrence of an event.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this course we focus in the frequentist definition, the most widely used. However, we will see at the end of this section that the Bayesian definition is important as it constitutes the foundation of the Bayesian approach to statistics, after Thomas Bayes (18th century).\n\n\n\n\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\n“As an experiment is repeated over and over, the observed frequency approaches the true probability”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Coin tossing\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows the frequency of heads in up to 200 simulated coin tosses. We can see that the frequency approaches the value 0.5 as the number of tosses grows.\n\n\n\n\nThe frequentist view of probability interprets the frequency of an event in a large number of experiments as its probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Births in Norway\n\n\n\n\n\nGiving birth to a girl or a boy is perceived as a random event. This table contains the frequencies of occurrence of the event “giving birth to a girl” in Norway during 2019-2022\n\nSource: Statistisk sentralbyrå\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nTotal number of births\nNumber of boys\nNumber of girls\nPercentage of girls\n\n\n\n\n2022\n51480\n26445\n25035\n48.6\n\n\n2021\n56060\n28684\n27376\n48.8\n\n\n2020\n52979\n27063\n25916\n48.9\n\n\n2019\n54495\n28042\n26453\n48.5\n\n\n\nThe probability of giving birth to a girl in Norway is approximately 0.49"

A probability equal to 0 means that the event can never occur, and equal to 1 means that the event is certeinly occuring.\nThe sum of all probabilities in a sample space equals 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples: Stochastic trials\n\n\n\n\n\nDice tossing\n\nSample space: {1,2,3,4,5,6}\nEvents:\n\nEven number of eyes: {2,4.6}\nMore than 3 eyes: {4,5,6}\n\n\nChild birth\n\nSample space: {B,G}\nEvents:\n\nHaving a girl: {G}\nNot having a girl: {B}\n\n\nDiastolic blood pressure\n\nSample space: {40,41,…,119,120}\nEvent:\n\nHypertension: {91,92, …, 120}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenn diagram\nVenn diagrams are often used to illustrate events.

First, create a new variable highpef that indicates whether pefmean is above 500.\n\n# if you use rda data file: \n# load('./data/PEFH98-english.rda')\n\n# if you use csv: \nlung_data <- read.csv('data/PEFH98-english.csv', sep = ',')\n# head(lung_data)\n\n# examine variable pefmean\n# visualise the distribution\nhist(lung_data$pefmean)\nabline(v = 500, col = 'red', lwd = 2)\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple ways to do it. Here we show two of them.\nIn option 1, we use the function ifelse(). It will create a binary vector, and fill in different output based on whether the condition was true or not.\n\n# option 1\n# code new variable: highpef with cutoff = 500\n# this is a binary variable, 1 means yes (higher than 500), 0 means no\nhighpef <- ifelse(lung_data$pefmean > 500, '1', '0')\n\n# check if it makes sense\nhead(lung_data$pefmean)\n\n[1] 405.0000 491.6667 505.0000 513.3333 725.0000 602.5000\n\nhead(highpef)\n\n[1] \"0\" \"0\" \"1\" \"1\" \"1\" \"1\"\n\n\nIn option 2, we create a vector with a pre-specified value, then replace the elements for given indices.\n\n# option 2 \n# create a vector with all '0's\n# then set the elements above 500 in 'pefmean' as '1'\n# (replacement with index)\n\nn <- length(lung_data$pefmean) # 106\nhighpef_alt <- rep('0', n) # repeat '0' 106 times\nhighpef_alt[lung_data$pefmean > 500] <- '1'\nhead(highpef_alt)\n\n[1] \"0\" \"0\" \"1\" \"1\" \"1\" \"1\"\n\n\n\n\n1b)\nWe investigate the association between these two variables via an appropriate table analysis. Make a table of highpef vs gender, which counts the number of subjects having each one of the four combinations in a 2 by 2 contingency table.\nYou can do this with table() command: it counts how many observations equals to each unique value in the data.

The main variable in the study was birth weight, BWT, which is an important indicator of the condition of a newborn child. Low birth weight (below 2500 g) may be a medical risk factor. A major question is whether smoking during pregnancy influences the birth weight. One has also studied whether a number of other factors are related to birth weight, such as hypertension in the mother.\nThe variables of the study are\n\nIdentification number (ID)\nLow birth weight\nAge of the mother (AGE)\nWeight (in pounds) at last menstruaal period (LWT)\nEthnicity, 1 means White, 2 means African American, 3 meaans other (ETH)\nSmoking status, 1 means current smoker, 0 means not smoking during pregnancy (SMK)\nHistory of premature labbour, values 0, 1, 2… (PTL)\nHistory of hypertension, 1 is yes, 0 is no (HT)\nUterine irritability, 1 is yes, 0 is no (UI)\nFirst trimester visits, values 0, 1, 2… (FTV)\nThird trimster visits, values 0, 1, 2… (TTV)\nBirth weight (BWT)\n\n\n2a)\nDoes smoking influence the birth weight of a baby?\nMake a histogram and a box plot, and find the median and mean for birth weight in grams (bwt) for the two groups of mothers: one group that smokes, and one that does not smoke durinng the pregnancy.

    "text": "Overview\nIn the previous section (EDA Part I), we have introduced some basic manipulation, where we focused mostly on 1 or 2 variables.\nIn this part, we will introduce how to\n\nselect multiple columns from a data frame (base R and tidyverse);\nassign new column names for variables (base R and tidyverse);\nexplore a dataset with slightly more advanced visualization using ggplot.\n\nTidyverse is a collection of R packages for data manipulation and visualization. It is widely used in the R community, both in academia and industry.\nThis course is introductory statistics where statistical methodology is the focus. However, we think that exploratory data analysis (EDA) and an intuitive way of understanding of your data is crucial for selecting the correct method; that is why we have this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo I need to learn tidyverse and ggplot?\n\n\n\nTidyverse data manipulation and ggplot are for slightly more experienced R users; no, you do not need them for your home exam.\nIf you are new to R, focus on base R functions and plots (scatter, boxplot, histogram, qqplot).\n\n\n\nExplore dataset: length of hospital stay\nThe data liggetid was collected at the Geriatric Department at Ullevål Sykehus. For a complete description of the variables, please refer to Exercise 2 in Non-parametric tests.\nWe will focus on the following variables:\n\nYear of hospital admission (innaar)\nGender, men and women (kjoenn)\nAdmission from, where 1 = home, 2 = Div. of Medicine, 3 = Div. of Surgery, 4 = Other division, 5 = Other hospital, 6 = Nursing home (kom_fra)\nStroke, where 1 = yes, 0 = no (slag)\nAge (alder)\nHospital stay, in days (liggetid)\n\nWe will first select a subset of the variables above from the original dataset, rename the variables, filter (to extract rows or subjects from) the dataset based on one or several conditions; and then introduce some advanced visualization techniques as part of the exploration (not required in home exam).\n\nliggetid <- read.csv('data/liggetid.csv')\nhead(liggetid, 3)\n\n  faar fmaan fdag innaar innmaan inndag utaar utmaan utdag kjoenn kom_fra slag\n1 1906     3    4   1987       3      5    87      3    18 kvinne       1    0\n2 1891     4    3   1987       3      6    87      3    23 kvinne       1    0\n3 1908     9    6   1987       3     10    87      3    16 kvinne       1    0\n  alder liggetid lnliggti kom_fra2 kom_fra3 kom_fra4 kom_fra5 kom_fra6 status\n1    81       13 2.564949        0        0        0        0        0      1\n2    96       17 2.833213        0        0        0        0        0      1\n3    79        6 1.791759        0        0        0        0        0      1"
