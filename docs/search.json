    "text": "Here you will find useful information on how to get started.\nIn this workshop we will be using R. You can either\n\n(recommended) have R and Rstudio installed on your laptop\nor, use Posit cloud (formerly Rstudio Cloud).\n\n\nOption 1: Set up your RStudio on your laptop\nYou will need both R and Rstudio, they are two separate things.\nYou can download Rstudio here. In this page it will ask you to install R, so it should be clear to follow.\n\nYou can download R for Linux, macOS or Windows here or here\n\nOnce you have finished installing both R and Rstudio, open Rstudio, and you should be seeing something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWatch these YouTube videos if you are stuck.\n\n\n\n\nOption 2: Use Posit Cloud\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is recommended to have R and Rstudio installed on your laptop, this is because you have a better control of where you prefer to download data and course material. This is also useful when you want to analyse your own datasets. For example, you might have to upload datafiles to the server for Posit Cloud to work.\nHowever, if there is a problem with the installation, you can use Posit Cloud as an alternative.\nOn Tuesday morning we will see if most people can successfully make R run on their laptop and make necessary adjustments.\n\n\nPosit Cloud is free of charge for personal users. You need to sign up for a new user account and have internet connection.\n\nOnce you signed up, you can open a new workspace, and it will look like something like this. If it is the first time you use Posit Cloud, it will be empty (i.e. no script or data).\n\n\n\nData\nThe datasets used in this course are stored in this folder.\n\nDownload data\n\nGo to the repository, select the data you want to download by left-click the file name\nIf it is a dataset in .csv, .txt format, you will see something like this\n\n\n\nfind Raw button, right-click, you will see a list of options\nchoose Download Linked File, this will download the data into your default download folder\nalternatively, choose Download linked file as… so that you can change where you put it and file name.\n\n\nIf it is a dataset in .dta, .xlsx or other format, you might not see the data directly:\n\n\n\nfind Download button, left-click, and you will download it into your default download folder.\n\n\nOptional: download data via URL\nIf you feel like it, you can also download data inside R via URL. You can read more about it here.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nR scripts are stored in this folder.\nTo download an R script, it is similar to downloading a dataset\n\nAlternatively, you can create your own R script locally inside Rstudio, by copy and paste the script from Github.\n\n\nResources\nYou will find the material used in class on this page.\nWe keep updating the material, so please stay tuned!\n\nBooks and papers\nYou can find these books in the library.\n\nEssential medical statistics (Kirkwood and Sterne, 2nd edition, 2003) (link\nStatistiske metoder i medisin og helsefag (Aalen, Frigessi, Moger, Scheel, Skovlund og Veierød, 2 utg, 2018) (link)\n\n\n\nVideos\nInstall R and Rstudio YouTube videos"

The probability of error is 0.2%.\nA false negative might be that antibodies are not yet produced in sufficient quantity, hence are not detected by the test. The probability of error is 2%.\nAssume that prevalence of HIV is 0.1%.\nWhat is the probability of a person having HIV, if he got a positive test result?\nWhat is the probability of a person not having HIV, if he got a negative test result?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: HIV testing I\n\n\n\nRecall the relation between sensitivity and false negative, and between specificity with false positive.\nWe know the following information about the test:\n\nfalse negative rate \\(FNR = 2\\%\\): sensitivity \\(\\text{sens} = 1-2\\% = 98\\%\\)\nfalse positive rate \\(FPR = 0.2\\%\\): specificity \\(\\text{spec} = 1-0.2\\% = 99.8\\%\\)\n\nFor 100 000 persons,\n\nNumber of HIV infected (positive condition): \\(100000 \\times 0.001 = 100\\)\nTrue positives: \\(100 \\times 0.98 = 98\\)\nFalse negatives: 2\nNumber of not HIV infected (negative condition): \\(100000-100 = 99900\\)\nFalse positives: \\(99900 \\times 0.002 = 199.8\\), say \\(200\\)\nTrue negatives: \\(99900 \\times 0.998 = 99700\\)\nPositive predictive value, \\(PPV = TP/(TP+FP) = 98/(98+200)= 0.329\\)\nNegative predictive value, \\(NPV = TN/(TN+FN) = 99700/(99700+2) = 0.9999\\)\n\n\n\nWe can also use the formula.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: HIV testing II\n\n\n\n\\(PPV = \\frac{\\text{sens} \\cdot \\text{prev}}{\\text{sens} \\cdot \\text{prev} + (1-\\text{spes}) \\cdot (1-\\text{prev})} = \\frac{0.98 \\times 0.001}{0.98 \\times 0.001 + 0.002 \\times 0.999} = 0.329\\)\n\\(NPV = \\frac{\\text{spes} \\cdot (1-\\text{prev}) }{(1-\\text{sens}) \\cdot \\text{prev} + \\text{spes} \\cdot (1-\\text{prev})} = \\frac{0.998 \\times 0.999}{0.98 \\times 0.001 + 0.998 \\times 0.999} = 0.999\\)\n\n\n\n\nFalse positive, PPV and revalence\nAs can be seen from the HIV example, PPV (i.e. the probability of detecting an actual condition, when the test is positive) depends on prevalence.\n\nWhen prevalence is 1/10000, 1/1000, 1/100, 1/10\nCorresponding PPV: 5%, 33%, 83%, 98%\n\nThe risk of getting false positives is greater for rare diseases, and smaller for more common diseases.\nFalse positives are problematic in mass screening for disease. It is possible that the majority of the positives (test results) are false positives."

The main variable in the study was birth weight, BWT, which is an important indicator of the condition of a newborn child. Low birth weight (below 2500 g) may be a medical risk factor. A major question is whether smoking during pregnancy influences the birth weight. One has also studied whether a number of other factors are related to birth weight, such as hypertension in the mother.\nThe variables of the study are\n\nIdentification number (ID)\nLow birth weight, 1 means \\(BWT \\leq 2500g\\), 0 means \\(BWT > 2500g\\) (LOW)\nAge of the mother (AGE)\nWeight (in pounds) at last menstruaal period (LWT)\nEthnicity, 1 means White, 2 means African American, 3 meaans other (ETH)\nSmoking status, 1 means current smoker, 0 means not smoking during pregnancy (SMK)\nHistory of premature labbour, values 0, 1, 2… (PTL)\nHistory of hypertension, 1 is yes, 0 is no (HT)\nUterine irritability, 1 is yes, 0 is no (UI)\nFirst trimester visits, values 0, 1, 2… (FTV)\nThird trimster visits, values 0, 1, 2… (TTV)\nBirth weight (BWT)\n\n\n2a)\nDoes smoking influence the birth weight of a baby?\nMake a histogram and a box plot, and find the median and mean for birth weight in grams (BWT) for the two groups of mothers: group 1 that smokes, and group 2 that does not smoke durinng the pregnancy. (Hint: use variable SMK for this task)\n\n\n2b)\nAre the distributions for the two groups normal? Can we conclude that smoking has an effect on the weight of a newborn? Use a t-test.\n\n\n2c)\nDo mothers of hypertension have a tendency to have babies with a lower birth weight? (The variable for hypertension is HT)\nMake a histogram of birth weight for the two groups of mothers with and without hypertension. What do you observe?"
